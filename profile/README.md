## 🏗️ Ecosystem Architecture

Our ecosystem is engineered as a unified, high-confidence vertical for mobility forensics. We balance public transparency for urban integration with strict industrial sovereignty.

### 🚀 The Gateway: GuardDrive Pilot
The **GuardDrive Pilot** is our public-facing terminal and high-fidelity **Digital Twin**. It virtualizes urban environments (Living Lab Salvador) to demonstrate the SEVE-Symbeon protocol at work.

> *Material proof of the SEVE-Symbeon protocol in real-time.*

### 📋 Public Verification
For grant evaluators, a sanitized technical showcase is available in our **submission-portal**, demonstrating our TRL 6+ readiness without compromising core strategic IP.
